<!--<h1 style="font-size:40px;color: 40px;color:#a583c2">Welcome to Bethany's Pie Shop</h1>
<h2>This is our history</h2>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;font-weight: bold;color:blueviolet">

    For many years, <b>Bethany</b> has been baking the most <i>delicious pies</i> at her home. In 2013, we opened
    our first
    store in Brussels (Belgium) in a cosy little street near the Grand Market. People from all over the world fell
    in love
    with the soft cakes, heavenly cheese cakes, spicy apple pies... <em>he store became a success in no
        time.</em><br>
    In 2015, no less than 100 pies were sold every day and Bethany's Pie Shop moved into a larger building.
    After receiving many requests, it became clear that our next step was making it possible to order pies from the
    comfort of your own home and from anywhere in the world. <br><br> You are now looking at the result of this: our
    very own
    webstore, making it possible to order Bethany's delicious pies whenever you feel like it!
